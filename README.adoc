=== Setup

This uses the Go standard library HTTP server, along with the cq library, and a mix of standard database/sql and jmoiron/sqlx functionality.

=== Run locally:

Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser].
Then install the Movies data-set with `:play movies`, click the statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

Start this application with:

[source,shell]
----
PORT=8080 go run server.go
----

Go to http://localhost:8080

You can search for movies by title or and click on any entry.

Note: _If you get an `http: panic serving` error, you likely have auth configured.  Simply update the neo4jURL var in server.go to "http://username:password@localhost:7474"._

=== Deploy to Heroku

# create a new app with the go buildpack
heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
